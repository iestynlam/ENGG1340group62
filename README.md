# ENGG1340 GROUP 62 PROJECT
## Problem Statement:

**Features of the Program**
1. Search commodities according to different filters (e.g. in-stock/out-of-stock)
2. Insert new commodity with basic information (name, manufacturer, amount, price, availability of shop(s)) after each procurement
3. Delete obsolete commodities
4. Update commodity information
5. Automatic change of inventory status according to the amount of commodity that is currently available (e.g. when the amount reaches zero, the inventory status would become "out-of-stock")
6. Deliver alerts when the commodity is "out-of-stock"
*OUR OWN FUNCTIONS*
7. Overflowing alert - if a commodity remains in stock for a very long time, there may be a danger of expiry orÂ change in sale policy. (Concept of first-in-first-out / first-in-late-out)
8. (maybe) Algorithms to track which commodity has the highest chance of running out of stock, potentially can be done by setting a time period of e.g. 1 week and checking which commodity has the largest stock decrease.
